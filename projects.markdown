# [NooDS](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/NooDS)
My longest-running project is NooDS, a DS and GBA emulator with ports for many platforms. The DS is my favorite system, so this was my goal when I got into emulation development. It may not have all the fancy features that other emulators do, but it has become pretty mature and should run most games without any issues.

# [rokuyon](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/rokuyon)
What started as a way for me to research N64 hardware became an emulator that... kinda functions! rokuyon can run a variety of N64 games, but it's still pretty unfinished and has a lot of problems. I wouldn't recommend it as a dedicated emulator just yet, but you can check it out if you're curious.

# [sodium64](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/sodium64)
I thought it would be neat to write something in assembly, and I decided on a SNES emulator for the N64. The name sodium64 is a play on neon64, the NES emulator. Certain visual effects might not be possible to emulate efficiently, but a lot of games are quite playable regardless. Some might even run at full speed!

# [Project DS](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/Project-DS)
This project's not an emulator, but it does allow playing things on the DS that weren't designed for it. Project DS is an engine that loads files dumped from the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA rhythm games. It recreates most gameplay elements and can be a fun way to play your favorite songs on the go!

# [Super Mario 64 DSi](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/sm64)
It's a bit tricky to name this one, since Super Mario 64 DS already exists. This is actually a port of the original N64 version of the game for the DSi! It has some minor issues, but should still be fully playable. I unfortunately can't provide builds, but the process of making one yourself should be straightforward.

# [VitaControl](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/VitaControl)
This was a bit of an impulse project, since I wanted to use a DualSense controller on my PS Vita. VitaControl allows you to do exactly that, and it supports various other Bluetooth controllers as well. If a controller isn't supported, the code is designed to make it easy to add.
